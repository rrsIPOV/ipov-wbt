This is the latest, and last iteration of iPOV.net's eLearning "Player" technology.

It is "standalone" player - it can run completely client-side, although due to browser security
you either need to package it with some sort of mini-server (Mongoose, etc...) or as a XUL or AIR type app. when not running from a server.

Code is HTML, CSS, Javascript, using JQuery + the RequireJS AMD loader + a handfull of other modules (jquery-bbq and amplify.store).

It is based on reading a site.js (actually json) configuration file, typically combined with a catalog.xml media info file.

The current version can only play Flash (AVM2 SWFs or FLV) files, however the basic structure is quite expandable, and many other file types could be easily enabled.

It has a SCORM 1.2 compatibility layer (on by default) which can be used (with a proper manifest) to host the site in an LMS.
Multiple "modes" of SCORM operation are possible (for a packaged site), but the only one currently supported is to consider the entire WBT as a single SCO.
Alternative modes should be pluggable with not too much extra work - see net_ipov/wbt/lms/factory.js

See docs/api-guide.textile for basic configuration information.
