h1. Template for banner-body-footer

The 'banner-body-footer.html' template is designed to fill the entire <body> content

This template has three main 'container' blocks (the following are the HTML id attributes):

* banner-container
** banner-content
** banner-bottom
* content-container
** content-top
** content-main
** content-bottom
* footer-container
** footer-top
** footer-content


The most common use is to make the body 100% height, and setting the banner and footer to a fixed height and allowing the content to expand to fill the area.  With the proper CSS this means that the content-container will stretch to fill the remaining area.
